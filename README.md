# Information architecture

The web architecture is very simple. I have divided each section in a different html and css file in order not to have too much code in the same file and to be able to have everything orderly and clear. When starting the web these files are loaded in order. The data of the web, as for example the work experience, is not taken from the database but from a json file to be able to make changes, either in the data or in the design, without dying in the attempt.
I have not used any library or framework like boostrap or angular. It is true that it would have taken less time to make the web, but the loading time of the same would have increased because we load much more weight. That's why I used vanilla javascript, without JQuery either.

# Visual design

It is a very simple design, with very simplified data so that it is not "lazy" to read the web. In a real project I would have made all the data clickable and with a modal show all the data of the project. 
All clickable elements show the user who can interact with them, either with the cursor, a change of color or size.
